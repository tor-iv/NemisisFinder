# NemisisFinder
Based on the idea that oppisites attract or at the very least that by interacting with those with oppisites opinions and different perspectives. We at Nemsis Finder 
want to connect those with completely different opinions.
We aim to do this through the utilizaiton of google forms that have the users answer questions on a scale of 1 to 7. This form will subsequently be translated into 
a google sheet and thsu JSON or CSV and parsed through a python alorithim that agrretes absolute value of the difference in two participants score matching with
the greatest difference in scores being matched. 
Plans to convcert it into a MongoDB and eventually create better UI front-end
