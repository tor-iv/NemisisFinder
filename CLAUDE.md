# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**NemisisFinder** is a matchmaking application that connects people with opposite opinions and perspectives. Unlike traditional matching apps that find similarities, this project maximizes opinion differences to facilitate diverse conversations and challenge echo chambers.

## Current Status

This is an **early-stage project** with only conceptual documentation. No implementation code exists yet. The repository contains a README.md outlining the vision and planned approach.

## Learning Goals & Educational Approach

**IMPORTANT**: The developer is actively learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the full technology stack used in this project (Ionic, Angular, TypeScript, Capacitor, Firebase, Rust, WebAssembly). When working on this codebase, Claude should:

### Teaching Methodology
1. **Explain While Implementing**
   - Describe what each piece of code does and why
   - Explain JavaScript/TypeScript concepts (closures, promises, async/await, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)
   - Break down HTML structure and semantic meaning
   - Clarify CSS properties, selectors, flexbox, grid, and responsive design
   - Explain Ionic UI components and mobile-first design principles
   - Provide context for Angular patterns (components, services, directives, pipes, dependency injection)
   - Explain Capacitor APIs for native device features (camera, storage, push notifications)
   - Explain Firebase concepts (real-time listeners, security rules, cloud functions)

2. **Provide Conceptual Context**
   - Why certain patterns are used (e.g., "We use async/await here because...")
   - Trade-offs between different approaches
   - Best practices and common pitfalls
   - How pieces fit into the larger architecture

3. **Interactive Learning**
   - **Quiz periodically** to reinforce concepts just covered
   - Ask questions like: "Before I implement this, what do you think this CSS property will do?"
   - Suggest modifications: "Try changing X to Y and observe the result"
   - Check understanding: "Can you explain why we used const instead of let here?"

4. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Start with simpler implementations, then refactor to more advanced patterns
   - Introduce new concepts gradually with clear explanations
   - Build on previously learned material
   - Reference earlier code examples when introducing related concepts

5. **Practical Exercises**
   - Suggest small challenges related to current work ("Try adding a hover effect to this button")
   - Recommend experimental changes to deepen understanding
   - Point out areas to explore independently in documentation

### Example Interaction Pattern
```
When implementing a component:
1. Explain the component structure and lifecycle
2. Show the TypeScript class with detailed comments
3. Explain the HTML template and data binding
4. Walk through the CSS styling choices
5. Quiz: "What would happen if we changed this Observable to a Promise?"
6. Suggest: "Try adding a loading spinner while data fetches"
```

### Knowledge Check Topics
- **JavaScript**: Variables (let/const/var), functions, arrow functions, promises, async/await, array methods (map/filter/reduce), destructuring, spread operator, modules
- **HTML**: Semantic elements, forms, accessibility, data attributes
- **CSS**: Selectors, specificity, box model, flexbox, grid, positioning, responsive design, animations, CSS variables
- **TypeScript**: Types, interfaces, generics, decorators
- **Ionic**: UI components (ion-button, ion-card, ion-list), navigation (ion-router-outlet), theming, mobile design patterns
- **Angular**: Components, templates, directives, services, dependency injection, routing, forms, observables
- **Capacitor**: Native APIs (Camera, Filesystem, Push Notifications, Storage), plugins, platform detection
- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore queries, real-time listeners, security rules, cloud functions

The goal is to build a functional application while ensuring the developer deeply understands every line of code written.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Ionic 8+ with Angular 20+ (TypeScript-based cross-platform app)
- **Native Bridge**: Capacitor 6+ (access to native device APIs)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- **Matching Algorithm**: Rust (compiled to WebAssembly or Cloud Function)
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL document database)
- **Data Collection**: Google Forms → Google Sheets → Cloud Functions
- **Deployment Targets**: Web (PWA), iOS (App Store), Android (Play Store)

### Data Flow
```
Google Forms (questionnaire, 1-7 scale)
  ↓
Google Sheets (temporary storage)
  ↓
Cloud Function (data import)
  ↓
Firestore (persistent storage)
  ↓
Ionic/Angular App ←→ Firebase SDK (real-time sync)
  ↓                    ↑
  ↓                    ↑ (Capacitor Push Notifications)
  ↓                    ↑
Cloud Function (trigger matching algorithm)
  ↓
Rust Matching Engine (WebAssembly or serverless)
  ↓
Firestore (store match results)
  ↓
Ionic/Angular App (display matches)
  ↓
iOS/Android/Web (cross-platform deployment)
```

### Matching Algorithm
The core algorithm calculates opinion differences:
- Users answer questionnaire questions on a 1-7 scale
- Matching score = sum of absolute differences between user responses
- Goal: Match users with maximum total difference (most opposite opinions)
- Implementation: Rust for performance and safety in handling large-scale matching

## Philosophy

The project is built on the belief that "opposites attract" and that engaging with different perspectives has value. The matching strategy intentionally creates connections between people with divergent viewpoints to foster meaningful dialogue across differences.
